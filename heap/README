General:
	This module contains a simple implementation of a MinHeap and MaxHeap.

	More information about what a heap data structure is:
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)

Implementation details:
	The implementation is quite simple.
	Both MinHeap and MaxHeap inherit from the class _Heap.
	Their only difference is how they compare elements, with MinHeap
	keeping the smallest element on the top of the tree and MaxHeap the
	largest.

	Both classes provide the same API for accessing their functionality.
	The most useful are:
	insert -> inserts a new element (maintaining the heap property)
	remove -> removes the top element and rearranges the heap

	Method names starting with an underscore '_' are meant to be helper
	functions and not used publibly.

Notes:
	You can insert every kind of object, as long as these object can be compared to
	one another, e.g. object1 > object2 would not raise errors.

	The only element that you cannot put is None.

General:
	This program implements a simple huffman coding tree and uses it to compress files.
	The program can also decompress files, if it recognises its own format.

Limitations:
	When constructing the encoding tree, only 8-bit words are used as this is not meant to be a very
	sophisticated implementation.
	The file needs to be in memory all at once.
	Not very fast.

What to use for:
	Play around with the code and see how to make huffman codes.

Possible TODOs:
	* (DONE) Use a MinHeap structure in the construction of the tree, which speeds up the process of finding
	the two least frequent elements.
	* When decompressing, not all of the file needs to be in memory at once (use buffers)
	* The same for compressing.
